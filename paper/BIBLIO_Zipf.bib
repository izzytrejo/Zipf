We show that this law can be also generalized to series of numbers generated from more complex systems like the catalogs of seismic activity. Finally, we derive a relation between the generalized Benford's law and the popular Zipf's law which characterize the rank order statistics and has been extensively applied to many problems ranging from city population to linguistics.}

	abstract = {Zipf’s law has been found in many human-related fields, including
	language, where the frequency of a word is persistently found as a power law function
	of its frequency rank, known as Zipf’s law. However, there is much dispute whether it
	is a universal law or a statistical artifact, and little is known about what mechanisms
	may have shaped it. To answer these questions, this study conducted a large scale
	cross language investigation into Zipf’s law. The statistical results show that Zipf’s
	laws in 50 languages all share a 3-segment structural pattern, with each segment
	demonstrating distinctive linguistic properties and the lower segment invariably
	bending downwards to deviate from theoretical expectation. This finding indicates
	that this deviation is a fundamental and universal feature of word frequency
	distributions in natural languages, not the statistical error of low frequency words. A
	computer simulation based on the dual-process theory yields Zipf’s law with the same
	structural pattern, suggesting that Zipf’s law of natural languages are motivated by
	common cognitive mechanisms. These results show that Zipf’s law in languages is
	motivated by cognitive mechanisms like dual-processing that govern human verbal
	behaviors.},

	abstract = { Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution—the part of the distribution representing large but rare events—and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data, while in others the power law is ruled out. }

	English, French, German, Italian, Spanish, and Esperanto. We applied Zipf-based metrics on our corpus to extract distributions for word, word distance, word bigram, word trigram, and word length for each book. Statistical analyses show that Esperanto’s statistical proportions are similar to those of other languages. We then trained
	artificial neural networks (ANNs) to classify books according to language. The ANNs achieved high accuracy rates (86.3% to 98.6%). Subsequent analysis identified
	German as having the most unique proportions, followed by Esperanto, Italian, Spanish, English, and French.	Analysis of misclassified patterns shows that Esperanto’s

	abstract = {The emergence of a complex language is one of the fundamental events of human evolution, and several remarkable features suggest the presence of fundamental principles of organization. These principles seem to be common to all languages. The best known is the so-called Zipf's law, which states that the frequency of a word decays as a (universal) power law of its rank. The possible origins of this law have been controversial, and its meaningfulness is still an open question. In this article, the early hypothesis of Zipf of a principle of least effort for explaining the law is shown to be sound. Simultaneous minimization in the effort of both hearer and speaker is formalized with a simple optimization process operating on a binary matrix of signal–object associations. Zipf's law is found in the transition between referentially useless systems and indexical reference systems. Our finding strongly suggests that Zipf's law is a hallmark of symbolic reference and not a meaningless feature. The implications for the evolution of language are discussed. We explain how language evolution can take advantage of a communicative phase transition.}
